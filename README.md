# The Monkees

In this project I will be designing a user friendly website that allows for anyone to access music, events and some information on the monkees.
It will be using Javascript, Html, CSS and Jquery.
 
## UX
 
- - As a monkees fan, I want to hear the music of the monkees on their website, and can achieve this via the music page.
- - As a monkees fan, I want to learn more about the monkees on their website, and can achieve this via the about page.
- - As a monkees fan, I want to see the music of the monkees live, and can achieve this via the events page.

You can find my wireframe for my project via the following path:

## Features

My website will have 5 pages, each with a header, a main section and a footer.
A small alert bar will be on the top of the page allowing for users to know any brand new information, or to point them in a direction.

the 5 pages are:

- - Home page: basic info, the names of the members in the Monkees etc.
- - Events page: Will have events "Near" you, and events globally.
- - Music page: Will have the music uploaded in MP3 and MP4 formats for the user to listen to.
- - About page: Will have a more detailed description of who the monkees are and what they do.
- - Contact page: Will have a form that a user can fill out to get in touch.
 
### Existing Features
- Home page - the users first impression on the site.
- Alert bar - helps give the user some direction or updates them on news.
- Header - holds the menu, which shrinks into a smaller symbol for mobile devices.
- Footer - holds copyright, a small contact us and social links.
- Social links - 3 links which a connected to send the user to the Twitter, Facebook or Youtube of the monkees via a new tab.
- Hover - around the site, I have implimented minor hover states on buttons.
- Mini-about - This is info on the monkees in less detail.
- Scroll-Bar - This can be found on the mini-about feature, and is implimented through overflow.

### Features Left to Implement
- Events page
- Music page
- About page
- Contact page

## Technologies Used

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/#)
    - The project wirefram was created on **Balsamiq**.

- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
    - The project uses **HTML** for the website to be developed.

- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
    - The project uses **CSS** to give it customised design, responsive design, media quieries etc.

- [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/getting-started/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** such as CSS and Javascript bootstrap for simplified responsive design.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
